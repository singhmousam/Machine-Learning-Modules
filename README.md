Application of various ML algorithms on some popular datasets with highest accuracy. This can be used as standard comparison code for applying on some other similar datasets.

Comparison of Heirarchical Clustering and K-means Clustering on USArrests Dataset

Application is done in both languages R and Python and to conclude K-means was found to be better.
Although the data was very small to find the diffrence between the two clustering algorithms but way of working of Heirarchical Clustering 
and creation of very large matrices made it incapable for being implemented on large datsets.

The datset USArrests is also given along with the code.
